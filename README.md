<h1>A text editor GUI for Mario Party games (currently only for Mario Party 4)</h1>


<h2>Implemented functionalities:</h2>
- Batch edit (loads a .dat file and displays all content, allows editing)
<h2>WIP:</h2>
- Change character names (loads .dat file from a folder and replaces character names with user input)
- Change minigame names (defining arrays for different sections)
- BMP edit for GCRebuilder (adding GameCube hex header to a user-made bmp file)

<h2>How it works</h2>


The batch edit mode allows users to load a .dat file, reads the content and translates it to text using Mario Party-specific encoding.
It separates editable content (strings) from non-editable content (data and pointers for the game).

Non-editable character: *
Null character (0x00): _
String separator (0x0B): |

If some editable characters are missing, you can add them to the marioPartyMapping hash map in â€¦/model/HexFileUtils.java.

Batch edit truncates strings that are longer than the original to avoid issues in game and adds null padding if the new string is shorter.
