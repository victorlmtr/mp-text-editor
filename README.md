<h1>A text editor GUI for Mario Party games (currently only for Mario Party 4)</h1>


<h2>Implemented functionalities:</h2>

- Batch edit (loads a .dat file and displays all content, allows editing)

<h2>WIP:</h2>
- Change character names (loads .dat file from a folder and replaces character names with user input)\n
- Change minigame names (defining arrays for different sections)\n
- BMP edit for GCRebuilder (adding GameCube hex header to a user-made bmp file)\n

<h2>How it works</h2>


The batch edit mode allows users to load a .dat file, reads the content and translates it to text using Mario Party-specific encoding.\n
It separates editable content (strings) from non-editable content (data and pointers for the game).\n
\n
Non-editable character: *\n
Null character (0x00): _\n
String separator (0x0B): |\n
\n
If some editable characters are missing, you can add them to the marioPartyMapping hash map in â€¦/model/HexFileUtils.java.\n
\n
Batch edit truncates strings that are longer than the original to avoid issues in game and adds null padding if the new string is shorter.\n
